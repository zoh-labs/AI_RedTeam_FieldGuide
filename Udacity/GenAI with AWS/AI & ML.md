- [ ] ML is a subset of AI focused on training machines to learn from data and improve

## Building
- [ ] data = the foundation
- [ ] ML algorithm code = the rulebook
- [ ] Machine Learning Model = the brain
- [ ] Machine Learning system = blend of data, algorithms and ML model
- [ ] Machine learning model = system's intellect; predictions, decisions
- [ ] Training = nurturing the model by processing data through the ML algorithm code
- [ ] Testing = gauging model
- [ ] iteration= tweaking algorithms, data to uplift model performance
