## Train the model to optimize on performance:
- [ ] decision trees: flowchart like structures to help in decision making
- [ ] regression: predicts numerical values by modeling relationships between variables
- [ ] clustering algorithms or K-means: groups data into clusters based on similarity to help with categoration/data segmentation
- [ ] deep learning (for complex tasks/neural networks)

## Deep Learning
- [ ] artificial neural networks (ANNs): inspired by human brain
- [ ] convolutional neural networks (ANNs): specialized for vision, preserving of spatial context images
- [ ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): efficient for sequential data, aiding in tasks like predictive text

## Advanced Deep Learning
- [ ] Generative models: generate new data samples similar to input; good for creating new content
- [ ] Transformer architecture: hs encoders and decoders, crucial in language translation and code generation tasks
