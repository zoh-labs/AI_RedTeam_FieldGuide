Supervised Learning
Like Learning with a Teacher - You provide the model with data and the correct answers (labels) for each data point, much like showing a picture of a cat and telling the model it's a cat.
When to Use - If you have labeled data and you want the model to learn the right answer from this data.
Examples - Classifying images, speech recognition, self-driving car tasks like identifying pedestrians, bank fraud detection.

Unsupervised Learning
Learning on its Own - The model explores a lot of data on its own to find patterns and structures, akin to solving a puzzle without seeing the picture on the box.
When to Use - If you have unlabeled data and you want the model to find patterns or structures in the data.
Examples - Generating new songs, writing code, handling massive datasets with unlabeled data.

Reinforcement Learning
Learning by Trial and Error - The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for right actions and penalties for wrong ones, much like training a pet.
When to Use - When you want your model to learn from its interactions and feedback, without needing labeled data.
Examples - Playing video games, robotics, real-time decision-making in self-driving cars.

In more complex real-world problems, a blend of these learning types might be employed, with multiple models each handling specific tasks, much like a team of specialists working together towards a common goal.
